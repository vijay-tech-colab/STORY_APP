# 📸 WhatsApp Stories Clone (MERN Stack)

This project replicates a basic **WhatsApp Stories** feature using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Users can upload images as stories, view them in a popup with a timed progress bar (auto-close after 5 seconds), and see recent uploads. The app also includes a **chat section placeholder** for future expansion.
